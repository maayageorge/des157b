        <h2>"We explored university syllabi to identify the literary canon" by Matt Daniels</h2>
        <img src="images/article1.jpeg" alt="screen capture">
        <p>Matt Daniels‚Äô website about literature uses a narrative style swipe-based interface to examine which books from the 1990s are assigned in today‚Äôs English classes. I really like the intuitiveness of the swipe element and am considering incorporating something similar in my capstone project. I also like the way he uses data, charts, tables, and images to highlight important points. I definitely want to utilize data about technology in fashion and convey my data in graphical forms.</p>

        <h2>"Watch women's hoops signature sneakers morph from Swoopes to Stewie" by Jan Diehm</h2>
        <img src="images/article2.jpeg" alt="screen capture">
        <p>Jan Diehm‚Äôs website illustrates a visual history of iconic shoes from the WNBA. I love the design of the website with the animations and vector illustrations for each shoe. I also like the navigation menu at the top, and I would like to have a similar type of navigation for my own website. My project will explore fashion of the future, and similar to how Diehm details the historical context and significance of each shoe to her overarching theme, I would like to inform my users about various fashion pieces in a visually appealing and comprehensive way.</p>
