        <h1> ⭑ ★ ⭑ Capstone Project Proposal ⭑ ★ ⭑ </h1>

        <p>For my capstone project, I plan to explore the future of fashion. More specifically, I want to consider how technologies such as AI or AR and wearable technology as well as bio-textiles can be utilized to improve online shopping experiences and the sustainability of fashion. My primary target audience would be young adults, who are the biggest consumers of fashion. I would also like to target fashion industry professionals such as designers, models, and stylists. It depends on the direction I take my project in, which I am still thinking about as of now. I would be open to working with a partner, but for now, I am working alone.</p>
        <p>My topic relies on speculative design and challenging mental models of what fashion looks like, fears about technology’s advancements, and the issues of fast fashion and overconsumption. I have a rough idea of a platform where users can explore wearable technology and garments made from bio-fabrics. I imagine my project would include many interactive elements and be formatted like an online store.</p>
        <p>As for concerns, I worry about the complexity of the project and the various elements that I would need to consider. I want to keep it simple with a low cognitive load for users while still being impactful. Although I have a general sense of the direction I am going, I am still deciding what exactly I will do for my project because I have many ideas!</p>
