        <h1> ⭑ ★ ⭑ Capstone Project Proposal ⭑ ★ ⭑ </h1>

        <p>For my capstone project, I plan to explore the future of fashion and commerce. More specifically, I want to consider how technologies such as AI or AR can be utilized to improve online shopping experiences. My primary target audience would be young adults, who are the biggest consumers of fashion. I would also like to target fashion industry professionals such as designers, models, and stylists. It depends on the direction I take my project in, which I am still thinking about as of now. I would be open to working with a partner, but for now, I am working alone.</p>

        <p>My topic relies on speculative design and challenging mental models of what shopping looks like, fears about AI’s advancements, and the issues of fast fashion and overconsumption. I have a rough idea of a platform where users can describe their personal or ideal style and AI will curate a feed of secondhand, sustainable clothes that fit their aesthetic from various sources. I want to make it fun and cute and encourage users to avoid fast fashion and find higher quality clothes for the sake of the environment. I imagine my project would include many interactive elements, such as onboarding for users to curate their style. I might make it like a social media page where users can customize the way the platform looks by changing the background colors and fonts and maybe even having avatars of themselves. I also wonder if I should incorporate an educational aspect that delves into the benefits of shopping sustainably.</p>

        <p>As for concerns, I worry about the complexity of the project and the various elements that I would need to consider. I want to keep it simple with a low cognitive load for users while still being impactful. Although I have a general sense of the direction I am going, I am still deciding what exactly I will do for my project because I have many ideas!</p>
