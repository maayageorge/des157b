            <h2>Test Observations:</h2>
            <p>I had the user explore my website and follow the usability test instructions. During the test, I observed that she seemed confused about the data visualization page being linked both on the top menu bar and via a button on the front page. Additionally, she had difficulty finding the showcase area on the home page. She also seemed confused because the images on the front page wouldn’t load. However, she seemed to enjoy the animate on scroll feature I added to the showcase area.</p>

            <h2>Updates to be made:</h2>
            <p>I plan to make the entire website a single page, rather than having a separate About page, to create a more straightforward user experience. Additionally, I need to fix an issue with the images, which I discovered was due to adding my images to my JSON file incorrectly. After resolving this, I will enhance user interaction by using the Lightbox2 library to allow images to expand on click. To make the page more visually appealing, I plan to add some decorative elements. The current fonts clash, so I intend to change the body font to better compliment the title font.</p>
